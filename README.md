# Little Lemon Booking Website

## Overview
Developed as a part of Meta's Coursera Front-End Development course, this portal stands as the pinnacle project of the Front-End Development Track.

The portal demonstrates the implementation of a reservation feature on the Little Lemon site, using React Components to highlight proficiency in building with React. Additionally, it showcases the use of API calls.

Important: The only active feature on this portal, aside from its design, is the "Reserve a Table" option.
